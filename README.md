Technologies used in this App are:
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. JQuery
5. ReactJS
6. Python
7. MongoDB

This is a single page responsive web app, mostly static, while contact us form does HTTP POST request to server where Python (Flask web server) handles it and saves the data to MongoDB database while emailing the recipient and creator with appropriate message.

I worked on responsiveness of the app by using pure CSS and media queries. This app has been tested on a small screen device like 4.2 inch smartphone and a big screen 55 inch TV, while it was also tested by emulating different screen sizes on Google Chrome and FireFox.
